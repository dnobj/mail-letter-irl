# ChatGPT App Integration Learnings

This log captures short notes discovered while connecting Letter IRL to the ChatGPT Apps SDK in November 2025.

## 2025-11-07 — Tool Content Type Validation
- The MCP Inspector rejects tool responses whose `content` items have `type: "json"`; only the standard literal values (`text`, `image`, `audio`, `resource`, `resource_link`) are permitted.
- Resolution: emit a brief textual summary in `content` (e.g., `"Balance: 5 credits"`) and keep the detailed data plus metadata inside `structuredContent`. Widgets still render from `structuredContent`.
- Symptom in ChatGPT: tool call returned HTTP 200 but surfaced error code 424 with the message “issue retrieving your balance.” MCP Inspector showed `ZodError invalid_union` at `content[0].type`.

## 2025-11-07 — Initialization Flow
- ChatGPT sends two `initialize` requests with different `protocolVersion` values. Enabling `sessionIdGenerator` in the Streamable HTTP transport caused the second initialize to fail with “Server already initialized.”
- Resolution: remove the custom session ID generator so the transport remains stateless. `Mcp-Session-Id` headers are no longer required for subsequent requests.
